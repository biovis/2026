# Bio+MedVis Challenge @ IEEE VIS 2026

Interested in some hands-on practice with visualizing complex biological and medical data? The Bio+MedVis Challenge is a great opportunity to explore and ideate on new, exciting ways to make sense of high-dimensional datasets from simulations and medical imaging! This year, we have two exciting challenges:

<div style="float: left; margin: 0 1em 0 0; max-height: 100%;">
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/biovis-challenge/image8.png" alt="Challenge 1 illustration" style="display: block; max-height: 100%; height: 110px;" />
</div>
**Challenge 1:** This challenge is focused on adaptive molecular dynamics simulation data, which is used to explore how biomolecules change their structure and interact with other molecules over time. These simulations can reveal important changes and are essential to drug design. However, they generate large and abstract datasets that make it difficult to explore the changes, compare trajectories, or reason about molecular behavior across entire ensembles.   
[Learn more]({{site.baseurl}}/biovisChallenges_vis/challenge_1/) about the data and the challenge tasks.

    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/biovis-challenge/b1.png" alt="Challenge 1 illustration" style="display: block; max-height: 100%; height: 110px;" />
</div>
**Challenge 2:** A challenge based on OMAMA-DB, a large public dataset of 2D and 3D mammography images, combined with metadata, pathology labels, and automated lesion annotations. While this data supports large-scale analysis, it is difficult to explore beyond individual cases, making it challenging to spot patterns, compare annotations, and understand how image data, metadata, and AI-generated labels relate to each other.  
[Learn more]({{site.baseurl}}/biovisChallenges_vis/challenge_2/) about the data and the challenge tasks.

While some of the tasks in these challenges involve the design of an **interactive visualization system**, we also welcome submissions with a smaller scope, such as **sketches of novel visualization designs** and **prototypes** that do not have to be fully developed.  

The authors of accepted submissions will have the opportunity to present their work at the Bio+MedVis Challenge event - a half-day workshop collocated with [IEEE VIS 2026](https://ieeevis.org/year/2026/welcome/) conference (November 9-13, 2026, Boston, USA).

## Submission
Each submission is expected to address one or multiple tasks from one of these challenges. If the authors/teams wish to participate in both challenges, they should prepare two separate submissions. To participate, authors will be asked to submit a two-page PDF abstract with up to 5 additional figures. The abstract should include:
 - a thorough **description and justification** of visualization (and analysis) techniques – we encourage the authors to use the space to describe their approach, and keep background and data detail descriptions to a minimum (since this is the part of the challenge definition),
 - at least one or more **images** of the visualization,
 - we encourage the authors to submit a supplementary **video or screencast** (up to five minutes) to explain the visualization approach.
 - the two-page abstract must be formatted according to the [IEEE VGTC Conference Style Paper Guidelines](https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/publications/conference/).

## Important Dates
### Proceedings (pending approval)
We are currently negotiating the possibility of publishing the conference proceedings in IEEE Xplore. For submission to be considered for publication in proceedings in addition to conference presentation, the following deadlines apply (these deadlines are strict; no extension is possible due to the publisher's timeline).
- Submission: August 4th, 2026
- Notification: August 12th, 2026
- Camera-ready version: August 19th, 2026
- Bio+MedVis Challenge event: November 9-13, 2026 (half a day event at IEEE VIS 2026, precise date to be specified)
### Conference presentation only
We offer an extended deadline for submissions that will be considered only for the conference presentation and will not be included in proceedings.
- Submission: late August, 2026
- Notification & camera-ready version: September, 2026
- Bio+MedVis Challenge event: November 9-13, 2026 (half a day event at IEEE VIS 2026, precise date to be specified)

All submissions should follow the same guidelines specified above and will be considered as equal contenders for the challenge.

## Evaluation
All submissions will be evaluated in a single round revision process by at least two reviewers, coming from the challenge chairs and selected domain experts. Accepted submissions will be invited to present their results as a talk at the challenge workshop at IEEE VIS 2026 and, optionally, also as a poster at IEEE VIS 2026, and will be published on the challenge website after the conference. They will also have an opportunity to get in touch with the challenge authors to pursue extended follow-up publications. 

Strong, creative submissions have the potential for recognition with an **Award of Merit** or an **Award of Excellence**. 
Awards, at the discretion of evaluators, may be given according to the primary author’s status as a **_Student_** (BSc/MSc) or **_Researcher/Professional_**
(PhD and up). In the case of many submissions, Challenge organizers may further subdivide these status categories to better weigh the contribution against the
experience of the submitters.

**From Rendering to Reasoning: Evolving Visualization for Life Sciences**  
_[Stefan Bruckner](https://sbruckner.github.io/), Professor, Chair of Visual Analytics, University of Rostock, Germany._

**Talk Abstract:** In the past decades, visualization in the life sciences has matured from a focus on making images to a deeper mission of making sense. In this talk, I examine this evolution through the lens of human-computer collaboration: how we moved from raw rendering, to interpretable visual representation, to interactive co-exploration, and finally to reasoning and communication at scale. Along this trajectory, visualization has expanded its role from a technical enabler of data display to an intellectual partner in discovery and decision-making. The talk highlights key milestones, examples, and open challenges that illustrate how visualization increasingly serves as a medium for shared reasoning between humans, data, and intelligent systems.

With 1 in 3 people affected, neurological conditions are the leading cause of
illness and disability worldwide, per the World Health Organization \[1\]. Early
detection and diagnosis of such conditions that include Alzheimer’s or
Parkinson’s disease are key to treatment and improved patient outcomes.
Acquisition methods alongside standard imaging methods such as magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), are essential to support clinical researchers and
point-of-care medical staff. Such methods are often capable of detecting subtle
biochemical changes marking neurological abnormalities unidentifiable in medical
imaging.

**Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)** is one such acquisition method,
allowing for non-invasive assessment of tissue biochemistry that is essential
for tumor and radiotherapy studies in addition to early detection of other
neurodegenerative disorders.

While magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) produces a stack of high-resolution
anatomical images, MRS trades spatial for chemical information to produce a
spectral graph of localized concentrations of biochemical compounds known as
metabolites. Metabolites are indicated as one or multiple peaks of varying
signal intensities on the spectral graph, arranged by resonance frequency due to
the properties of the atomic nucleus used for the study. Generally speaking,
every metabolite can be identified by its **chemical shift**, i.e., its
difference in resonance frequency relative to a particular reference metabolite.

While hydrogen (1H) MRS is common, phosphorus (31P) is particularly useful in
cases where clinicians are interested in questions related to cellular
metabolism and oxidative stress, which are markers for a range of
neuropathological conditions \[3\]. Although these technologies have been
available for several years, technological advances are yielding new
opportunities to explore the metabolic changes in brain development and aging,
which in turn could yield new therapeutic approaches.

Illustrated below in **Fig. 1**, 31P-MRS is captured per-voxel with a structural
MR image that provides essential context for the location of each spectral
voxel. Following acquisition, model fitting and spectral quantification in
standard analysis tools results in a single spectral output graph containing
approximately 10 or fewer spectral peaks. Visualization standard practice for
this data is often limited to drawing the spectral graph, and the learning curve
to interpreting such data is steep – even in a successful acquisition, spectral
peaks can be difficult to identify and meaningful relationships are difficult to
understand. It is additionally important to clearly communicate the presence of
possible error or outliers to help researchers and clinicians understand whether
these issues arise from problems with data acquisition and processing, or if, in
the case of outliers, further exploration is meaningful. These challenges are
largely unmet in current clinical tools, and within the visualization community
research has mainly focused on 1H-MRS with different clinical considerations
\[6,7\]. It is difficult for researchers to learn to interpret these data, let
alone to interactively compare relative biochemical concentrations between
patients or at different times to understand metabolic changes or oxidative
stress.

### Redesign Challenge Task

For this redesign task, we challenge participants to propose an alternative
visualization approach that better enables clinicians and MRS researchers to
explore, analyze, and/or communicate these data in a more facile manner, for
instance to answer questions like:

-   How to more easily **identify** metabolites within a spectrum?
-   How to **assess the quality of a spectrum,** e.g., according to peak shape(s)?
-   How to **compare** peaks in a spectrum within and across subjects? These peaks are usually measured in terms of their amplitudes, or the area-under-the-peak.
-   How to **identify, compare and summarize ratio values** (often with phosphocreatine as the base comparison) between peaks in an intuitive way?

Submissions should consider visualization theory and principles. Most essential
to this challenge is the exploration of creative, novel ideas for this data and
associated tasks—as such, **sketching and prototyping as well as fully
interactive solutions are welcome**\!

### Data and Documentation

    <figcaption>
        <strong>Fig. 2</strong>. Rendering of one spectral output from the provided dataset. Peaks indicate metabolites in the sample. Important chemical shifts for metabolites of interest (as noted in below Table) are marked with vertical grey bars, and are based on the chemical shift table presented by Deelchand et al. [8].
    </figcaption>
</figure>

#### Example Dataset

The provided dataset includes 18 spectral outputs, one of which is illustrated
in Fig 2\. Each peak in this figure corresponds to a metabolite, for example,
phosphocreatine is the tall peak centered at approximately 0.0 parts per
million. The below table lists the more commonly-assessed metabolites and their
chemical shifts. Note that some metabolites have multiple peaks, e.g., DPG:

</figure>

For a detailed table of other metabolites and their chemical shifts, we refer to Deelchand et al. [8].

#### Data Description

The processed dataset for the redesign challenge is available for download at
the [BioMed+Vis 2025 Redesign Challenge
GitLab](https://git.app.uib.no/biomedvis2025/31p-mrs-redesign/-/tree/main/data?ref_type=heads).

The dataset we provide includes **18 pre-processed spectra**. The spectra are
split into two csv files:

-   `spectra.csv`: Each spectrum is a 2048 x 1 vector that represents the measured amplitude of a given metabolite at a given chemical shift for a single subject. There are 18 vectors for a total array size of 2048 x 18. These vectors represent the spectra for 9 individuals, all at the same voxel position with samples at two time points. The arrangement is such that `spectra[:,0]` and `spectra[:,1]` belong to **Subject00** at **t0** and **t1** respectively, `spectra[:,2]` and `spectra[:,3]`belong to **Subject01** at **t0** and **t1**, etc.
-   `chemical_shifts.csv`: All spectra from spectra.csv align with this 2048 x 1 vector that indicates the chemical shift (x-axis in Fig. 2). The chemical shifts of metabolites are usually referenced to Phosphocreatine (PCr) as an internal standard at 0.0 ppm.

For a bit more background on 31P-MRS, \[9\] and \[10\] provide a friendly
orientation to this kind of data. To see some of the types of work from the
visualization community for this kind of data, \[6\] and \[7\] are useful
starting points.

### Biological Background and Data Description

Highly multiplexed tissue imaging methods, such as Cyclic Immunofluorescence
(CycIF), which allow for the analysis of over 30 biomarkers on a single tissue
section, are essential tools for scientists to investigate the subcellular
complexities of cancer \[1\]. Indeed, CyCIF has been instrumental in revealing
immune-tumor interactions and the progression of melanoma at single-cell
precision \[2\]. More recently, researchers have extended these techniques to
image volumes, allowing for an even more comprehensive analysis of the diverse
_cell types_ and _states_ within the tumor microenvironment and their _spatial
interactions_ \[3\]. These volumes enable cancer biologists and pathologists to
explore hypotheses derived from 2D tissue images with enhanced detail and rigor,
facilitating deeper insights into cellular dynamics within the tumor
microenvironment. This approach allows them to examine the location and extent
of specific cell-cell interactions within a given volume. However, identifying,
visualizing, and analyzing these intricate interactions across volumes is a
challenging task, both computationally and visually. The focus of this BioMedVis
Challenge, therefore, is to develop algorithms and visualization techniques that
help experts search for and identify such cell-cell interactions, as indicated
by the presence of cells expressing certain biomarkers.

### Challenge Task

The starting Jupyter notebook presents several combinations of biomarkers that
represent known cell-cell interactions. We demonstrate how specific cells can be
determined based on the presence of these biomarkers. It is your task to
identify and visualize where such interactions occur within the tissue, both
globally and locally.

Participants must thus:

1. Develop an algorithm for identifying ROIs where cells expressing specific combinations of markers exist within the tissue volume.
2. Visualizing these ROIs at a global scale, helping experts assess the extent to which such interactions occur and the broad morphological regions in which these interactions are occurring.
3. Allow users to dig into specific ROIs at the cellular level.

In doing so, participants may choose to augment existing volumetric
visualization techniques or propose peripheral abstract visualizations. When
visualizing the volume, they may choose to identify view configurations of the
following form:

-   Camera:
    -   Zoom Level
-   Volume Settings:
    -   Translation (X, Y, Z)
    -   Rotation (X, Y, Z)
-   Channels:
    -   Selection, Color, and Value Range

### Data and Documentation

The data volume included in this challenge represents a 194x5508x10908 volume of
cancerous tissue belonging to a patient suffering from metastatic melanoma.
Scientists have identified “immune niches” in this tissue, which contain
specific interactions between immune cells of different types and states.

Also provided is a Jupyter Notebook (link/details), which includes a sample
dataset and some notable cell-cell interactions. This notebook uses Vitessce,
which participants are welcome to build on, though they may also develop their
own visualization/visual analytics systems or build on other systems.
